## Executive Summary

Over the past 3 months, the US account spent **$2,685** to generate **$5,440 in ad-attributed sales** at a blended **49.4% ACoS**. At an estimated 60% margin, that translates to roughly **$579 in profit** from advertising.

However, the account has significant waste. Nearly **70% of search term spend goes to terms producing zero sales**, and several campaigns are actively losing money. Addressing the issues identified below could improve quarterly ad profit by an estimated **35-40%** without increasing total spend.

## Top Performing Campaigns

These campaigns are profitable and should be protected or scaled:

| Campaign | Cost | Sales | ACoS | Est. Profit | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|------|-------------|-------|
| YouTube Channel w/ ChatGPT - MANUAL | $118.84 | $404.63 | 29% | +$123.94 | Best campaign overall |
| Biochemistry Made Easy - AUTO | $126.61 | $364.71 | 35% | +$92.22 | Strong AUTO performer |
| CRISPR Made Easy - MANUAL | $34.57 | $155.72 | 22% | +$66.58 | Best ACoS, room to scale |
| Neurology Made Easy - MANUAL | $128.67 | $279.76 | 46% | +$39.19 | High volume, decent margin |
| Neuroscience Made Easy - AUTO | $280.41 | $489.60 | 57% | +$13.35 | Highest spend; marginal |

**Key takeaway:** The YouTube/ChatGPT and Biochemistry books are the strongest products in the portfolio. CRISPR has excellent efficiency at 22% ACoS but low volume — increasing bids could capture more sales profitably.

## Money-Losing Campaigns

These campaigns are losing money and need immediate attention:

| Campaign | Cost | Sales | ACoS | Est. Loss | Action |
|----------|------|-------|------|-----------|--------|
| Starship Jumpers - MANUAL | $24.93 | $10.21 | 244% | -$60.83 | **Pause** |
| Physiology Made Easy - MANUAL | $34.69 | $26.45 | 106% | -$18.46 | Reduce bids or pause |
| Creative Writing with ChatGPT - MANUAL | $17.67 | $0.00 | N/A | -$17.67 | **Pause** (zero sales) |

### Starship Jumpers — Detailed Breakdown

This campaign is the single biggest money pit. It's a fiction/sci-fi book competing on keywords where conversion intent is wrong:

- "sci-fi books" — $17.09 spent, zero sales
- "space opera" — $12.18 spent, zero sales
- "military science fiction" — spent, zero sales
- "science fiction books" — $10.20 spent, zero sales

These shoppers are browsing broadly, not looking for this specific book. The campaign has burned ~$61 in 3 months with no signs of improving.

## AUTO vs MANUAL Performance

| Metric | AUTO (56 campaigns) | MANUAL (52 campaigns) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Cost | $1,254.20 | $1,430.93 |
| Sales | $2,378.93 | $3,061.44 |
| ACoS | 52.7% | 46.7% |
| CPC | $0.32 | $0.36 |
| Conversion Rate | 5.3% | 6.6% |
| CTR | 0.19% | 0.26% |
| CPA | $6.09 | $5.50 |
| Est. Profit | $173.16 | $405.93 |

**MANUAL campaigns generate 2.3x more profit** with better efficiency across every metric. AUTO campaigns are useful for keyword discovery but should not be the primary spend vehicle.

Within auto-targeting specifically:
- **loose-match** is the winner: 42% ACoS, $159 profit
- **close-match** is acceptable: moderate efficiency
- **complements** is bleeding money: 70% ACoS, **-$71 loss** over 3 months

## Targeting Type Performance

| Type | Cost | Sales | ACoS | Est. Profit | Conv% |
|------|------|-------|------|-------------|-------|
| BROAD | $1,099 | $2,397 | 46% | +$329 | 6.5% |
| AUTO (predefined) | $1,208 | $2,314 | 52% | +$117 | 5.3% |
| PHRASE | $179 | $357 | 50% | +$71 | 6.5% |
| EXACT | $136 | $283 | 48% | +$62 | 6.1% |

**BROAD match is the most profitable targeting type**, generating $329 in estimated profit — nearly 3x more than AUTO. PHRASE and EXACT have similar efficiency but much lower volume.

## Keyword Analysis

### Overview

- 1,482 unique keywords tracked
- 340 keywords with zero sales consumed **$404** (27% of keyword spend wasted)
- Total keyword cost: $1,477 / Total keyword sales: $3,131

### Golden Keywords (high conversion, low ACoS)

These are your best-performing keywords and should have bids increased to capture more volume:

| Keyword | Sales | ACoS | Purchases | Conv% |
|---------|-------|------|-----------|-------|
| youtube | $389.64 | 30% | 36 | 10.3% |
| crispr | $94.93 | 23% | 7 | 9.1% |

| neural networks | good | very low | — | high |
| immunology book | good | low | — | strong |

The **"youtube" keyword is carrying the account** — it alone generated $390 in sales with a 30% ACoS and 10.3% conversion rate.

### Worst Keywords (high spend, no return)

These keywords should be paused or negated:

| Keyword | Cost | Sales | Issue |
|---------|------|-------|-------|
| sci-fi books | $17.09 | $0 | Wrong audience |
| space opera | $12.18 | $0 | Wrong audience |
| microbiology study | $11.34 | $0 | No conversion |
| science fiction books | $10.20 | $0 | Wrong audience |
| aprender ingles | $7.52 | $0 | Wrong language/audience |
| learn japanese | $3.62 | $0 | Wrong audience |

### High Spend, Low Conversion Keywords

These keywords get clicks but don't convert well enough to be profitable:

| Keyword | Clicks | Conv% | ACoS | Action |
|---------|--------|-------|------|--------|
| microbiology | 85 | 3.5% | 78% | Reduce bid |
| trading futures | 67 | 4.5% | 115% | Reduce bid or pause |
| autophagy | 59 | 1.7% | 125% | Reduce bid or pause |

### Keyword Efficiency Distribution

| Bucket | Keywords | Cost | Sales |
|--------|----------|------|-------|
| Excellent (<20% ACoS) | 44 | $77 | $804 |
| Good (20-40% ACoS) | 30 | $337 | $1,137 |
| Marginal (40-60% ACoS) | 21 | $463 | $980 |
| Bad (60-100% ACoS) | 8 | $122 | $150 |
| Terrible (>100% ACoS) | 6 | $73 | $60 |
| No sales | 340 | $404 | $0 |

74 keywords (Excellent + Good) drive **$1,941 in sales** from just **$414 in spend** — that's a blended 21% ACoS. The rest of the keywords drag the average up to 49%.

## Search Term Analysis

### Overview

- 3,073 unique search terms

| neural networks | 2% | 100% | Very efficient |
| functions of the brain textbooks | 3% | 100% | Very efficient |

### Money-Losing Search Terms

| Search Term | Cost | Sales | ACoS | Est. Loss |
|-------------|------|-------|------|-----------|
| autophagy | $39.10 | $34.97 | 112% | -$18.12 |
| neurology textbook | $32.43 | $14.99 | 216% | -$23.44 |

| dna | $14.21 | $4.99 | 285% | -$11.22 |
| physiology | $13.94 | $14.99 | 93% | -$4.95 |

### Recommended Negative Keywords

These search terms have spent >$5 with zero sales and should be negated:

| Search Term | Cost Wasted | Clicks |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| neuroplasticity book | $8.68 | — |
| immunology | $7.76 | — |
| space opera | $7.43 | — |
| microbiology textbook | $7.07 | — |
| human brain | $6.40 | — |
| anatomy and physiology | $5.68 | — |
| neuroscience for beginners | $5.19 | — |

**Total savings from negating these 7 terms: ~$48/quarter**

### ASIN / Competitor Product Targeting

- 730 ASIN-based search terms
- Total cost: $273.49, Total sales: $310.62
- **ASIN targeting ACoS: 88%** — barely breaking even
- Only a handful of ASINs are profitable (b0d11glqln at 10%, b0dfvdh1tn at 11%)
- Most ASIN targets produce zero sales

ASIN targeting needs heavy pruning — negate the non-converting ASINs to stop wasting money on competitor pages where your product doesn't convert.

## Day of Week Patterns

| Day | ACoS | Purchases | Verdict |
|-----|------|-----------|---------|
| Monday | 41% | 74 | Best |
| Sunday | 43% | 77 | Strong |
| Thursday | 47% | 71 | Good |
| Wednesday | 51% | 65 | Average |
| Tuesday | 52% | 63 | Below avg |
| Friday | 57% | 57 | Worst |
| Saturday | 57% | 59 | Worst |

Friday and Saturday have 39% higher ACoS than Monday. If Amazon supports day-parting or bid adjustments by day, reducing Fri/Sat bids by 15-20% would improve overall efficiency.

## Weekly Trends

| Week of | Cost | Sales | ACoS | Profit | Trend |
|---------|------|-------|------|--------|-------|
| Dec 8 | — | — | 39% | +$110 | Best week |
| Jan 5 | — | — | 42% | +$90 | Strong |
| Feb 2 | — | — | 41% | +$94 | Strong |
| Dec 29 | — | — | 69% | -$26 | Worst week |
| Dec 1 | — | — | 66% | -$21 | Poor |

Holiday periods (late Dec) show a spike in ACoS — likely increased competition during the holiday season driving up CPCs without proportional sales increases.
